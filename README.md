# ML_from_scratch

## Overview

ML_from_scratch is a project that aims to build and understand machine learning algorithms from scratch. It focuses on implementing machine learning models and algorithms using fundamental programming techniques without relying on high-level libraries.


## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML_from_scratch.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ML_from_scratch
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the implemented algorithms. For example:

1. Import the necessary modules:
    ```python
    from src.linear_regression import LinearRegression
    ```
2. Load your data and use the algorithm:
    ```python
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```
